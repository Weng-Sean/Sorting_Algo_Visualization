# Sorting Algorithm Visualization with Pygame

This project is a Python application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms using the Pygame library. It allows you to observe and compare the performance of sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort. You can also extend this project to include other sorting algorithms of your choice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (You can install it using `pip install pygame`)

### Running the Application

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. The Pygame window will open, displaying bars that represent the unsorted data.
5. Press the close button on the window to exit the application.



## Usage
- Upon running the application, you will be presented with a window displaying randomly generated bars. The bars represent the data to be sorted.
- You can select different sorting algorithms by modifying the SORTING_ALGORITHM variable in the main.py script.
- The application will automatically start sorting the data using the selected algorithm upon launch.
- The time taken for the sorting process will be displayed on the screen.
- Close the Pygame window to exit the application.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. Insertion Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

3. Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

4. Selection Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

## Customization
Feel free to customize and extend this project:

Modify the number of bars (`BAR_NUMBER`) to change the dataset size.
Add other sorting algorithms by implementing their logic in separate Python files and integrating them into the main.py script.
Adjust the window size, colors, fonts, and other visual elements to fit your preferences.
